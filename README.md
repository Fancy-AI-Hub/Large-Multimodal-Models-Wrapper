# Large Multimodal Models Wrapper (LMMs)
- An academic site to centralize LMMs
- A unified repository to deliver the development of LMMs
- A wrapper to standarize new released LMMs

# Updates
- [7/2024] The project is initialized

# Convention
- This repository follows Torch and Hugging Face convention

# Structure
- Initially, each LMM consists of
    - Modeling: To develop LMMs architecture converted from literature reviews to source code. 
    - Dataset: To prepare unified datasets for training and evaluation consistently.
    - Training: To pre-train and finetune LLMs for research and application purpose.
    - Evaluation: To form benchmarks and fairly compare different LMM.
    - Inference: To investigate the usage and application of LMMs. 
    - Application: To have reality demos for research and PoC.
